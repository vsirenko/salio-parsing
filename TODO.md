# TODO

What the project does not have yet, roughly in the order it should be picked up.
Tick items off here when they land so the list stays honest.

## Security — do before anything is exposed

- [ ] **`POST /api/products` is open to everyone.** Auth exists but was never applied to
      products. Decide the model: catalogue public for reads, writes admin-only, or the
      whole thing behind a client token.
- [ ] **Account lockout is a denial of service.** Rate limiting is per account, so
      someone who knows an email can keep that account locked by failing on purpose.
      The window caps it at roughly 15 minutes at a time, but it does not go away.
      Usually answered by keying the lock on (account, address) or by a CAPTCHA.
- [ ] **Sessions cannot be revoked one at a time.** The token epoch ends all of an
      account's sessions at once; there is no list of active sessions and no way to
      sign one device out. Needs a `refresh_tokens` table with `jti`, rotation and
      reuse detection.

## Operations

- [ ] **No CI.** Nothing runs the tests, ruff or `alembic check` on a pull request.
      GitHub Actions on the same commands the hooks use locally.
- [ ] **Nothing prunes `login_attempts`.** Buckets stop mattering once their window
      has passed, but the rows stay. `ix_login_attempts_updated_at` is there for a
      periodic delete; there is no job to run it yet.
- [ ] **Audit retention and backup.** The trail grows without bound and nothing prunes,
      archives or backs it up. Decide a retention window; partition by month if it gets
      large.
- [ ] **Audit writes fail open, and it has already hidden a bug.** `AuditMiddleware`
      logs and swallows a failed write so the request still succeeds. Passing a `Decimal`
      to `record_changes` made the JSONB write fail; the endpoint returned 200 and simply
      left no record. Either make the serializer tolerate what services pass, or invert
      the middleware so an action fails when it cannot be recorded.
- [ ] **Production DB grants.** The audit table should be INSERT + SELECT only for the
      application user, so append-only is enforced by the database and not just by us
      not writing an endpoint.
- [ ] **Observability.** Logs are plain text; no structured JSON, no error tracking
      (Sentry), no metrics.

## Parser

The reason this repository exists, and none of it is built. The shape it should take,
and the questions that have to be answered with real data first, are written down in
[docs/parser-design.md](docs/parser-design.md).

- [x] Currency and country reference tables, admin-managed, seeded with the three
      Baltic markets. VAT rates are left null deliberately — see the migration.
- [ ] **Fill in the VAT rates** for LV, LT and EE. They were not seeded because they
      change and are not ours to guess; nothing computes with them, but they are what
      explains a price difference between markets.
- [x] Category tree with cascading visibility, and the canonical attribute registry
      with its aliases and per-category identity flags
- [ ] **The candidate queues are not built.** `attribute_candidate`,
      `attribute_value_candidate` and `brand_candidate` are what turns an unknown string
      into a mapping, and they are filled by ingestion — which does not exist yet. Build
      them with the parser, not before: a queue with no producer is furniture.
- [ ] **Nothing extracts attributes.** The registry can be filled by hand; pulling
      `256GB` out of a title still needs per-category patterns, and that is what
      `identity_ready` on a category is actually asserting.
- [ ] **Measure how far a deterministic matcher gets.** Everything else in that document
      is downstream of this number. 30-50 real offers from both kinds of source, with the
      same product sold by more than one shop.
- [ ] **Nothing fetches, normalizes, matches or records a price yet.**

## Features

- [ ] **No admin password reset.** An admin cannot set a password for a user who has
      forgotten theirs — only the account holder can change their own.
- [ ] **No password reset by email.** Blocked on there being no email at all; a
      forgotten password currently has no recovery path.
- [ ] **No password rules.** Only a length between 8 and 128 is enforced. No check
      against a breach list, no rejection of the obvious ones.
- [ ] **Products cannot be updated or deleted.** Create, list and get only.
- [ ] **No email.** Nothing verifies an address or sends a reset link.

## Nice to have

- [ ] Coverage gate in CI.
- [ ] Security headers and HTTPS redirect (usually terminated at the proxy).
- [ ] Background jobs, once anything needs to happen out of band.

## Done

- [x] PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy 2.0 async, Alembic migrations, docker-compose
- [x] Readiness probe that actually checks the database
- [x] JWT auth with separate client and admin audiences
- [x] Audit trail of admin actions
- [x] Shared pagination, offset and cursor
- [x] User update and deactivation, with the panel protected from self-lockout
- [x] Self-service password change, ending every other session
- [x] Token epoch, so a password change or deactivation revokes stateless tokens
- [x] Per-account and per-address rate limiting on both sign-in endpoints
